# vgfw - A Header File Game Engine

Inspired by @OneLoneCoder, I decided to create a header-only game engine in the fashion of his olcConsoleGameEngine.h. As well as inspiration I've borrowed a few lines of code from javidx9's engine. I wanted to have VGA quality graphics (mode-x of course), so my header file engine uses an 8-bit 320x240 framebuffer and even defaults to the original VGA palette.
